# Q-and-A

> how this package name `numqi` comes?

Initially, this package is named `numpyqi`, later it's shortened to be `numqi` (pronounce: num-py-q-i). The reason is that `numpy` is the most popular python package for numerical computation, and `numqi` is based on `numpy`. The name `numqi` is also a play on the word `numpy` and quantum information.

1. short, no more than 7 letters
2. keyword: quantum information, numpy, python, optimization
3. NEP41: should not include the whole word "numpy"
4. example (good and bad)
   * `numpyqi`: bad
   * `numqi`: pronounced as "num py q i", emphasize that it's based on numpy and focuses on quantum information field
   * `numqy`: bad, confused with `numpy`
